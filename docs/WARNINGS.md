# BabyCare App Warnings and Solutions

## Warning Summary

The BabyCare app currently shows several warnings during development:

1. `"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".`
2. `[expo-av]: Expo AV has been deprecated and will be removed in SDK 54. Use the 'expo-audio' and 'expo-video' packages.`
3. `props.pointerEvents is deprecated. Use style.pointerEvents`
4. `Error loading audio file: Numba needs NumPy 2.2 or less. Got NumPy 2.3.`
5. `DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated... Use timezone-aware objects`

## How to Address These Warnings

### 1. Run the Dependency Update Tool

We've created a script that helps address most of these issues:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd c:\Users\SHANMUKHSAI\Desktop\BabyCareApp

# Run the update script
npm run update-deps
```

This script will:
- Install NumPy 2.2.0 to fix the Numba compatibility issue
- Prepare for migrating from expo-av to expo-audio
- Fix the datetime.utcnow() deprecation warning
- Update React Native dependencies

### 2. Style Deprecation Warnings

For any remaining style warnings:

- Replace `shadow*` props with `boxShadow`
- Replace `props.pointerEvents` with `style.pointerEvents`

These changes have already been applied to the main components, but you might see warnings from third-party libraries.

### 3. Expo AV Migration

We've begun preparing for the migration from expo-av to expo-audio/expo-video, which will be required in Expo SDK 54.

A detailed migration guide is available at: `docs/expo-av-migration.md`

Full migration will require:
- Updating imports from `expo-av` to `expo-audio`
- Updating API calls to match the new library
- Testing on all platforms

### 4. Backend Issues

The NumPy version issue has been addressed by pinning it to version 2.2.0 in requirements.txt.

If you continue seeing the error, you may need to run as administrator:

```bash
pip install numpy==2.2.0
```

## Web Demo Mode

The app is designed to work in web demonstration mode with limited functionality.
This mode provides a simulated experience when running in a web browser.

For full functionality with accurate cry analysis, please use the native mobile app on iOS or Android.
